Cursor AI – Project Instructions: YouTube Watch Later Downloader (Local Tool)
Project Summary
Build a local tool that can automatically:
Access my YouTube Watch Later playlist.
Retrieve all video URLs.
Download each video in at least 720p resolution.
Save all files to a folder on my machine (e.g., /downloads/youtube_watch_later/).
The tool is for private personal use only.
Constraints & Notes
Must run locally (not hosted online).
Should avoid storing any login credentials in plain text.
Prefer Python or Node.js (whichever Cursor recommends).
Use well-maintained libraries (e.g., yt-dlp for downloads).
Ideally support a config file where I can set:
Download path
Resolution preference
Maximum concurrent downloads
Should handle:
Duplicates
Failed downloads (retry)
Videos unavailable or private
Authentication
YouTube OAuth is complex for CLI apps.
Preferred approaches (Cursor should choose the best and set up):
Option A — Use cookies.txt from YouTube
Extract cookies from browser (Chrome/Firefox extension).
Tool uses cookies for playlist access and download.
Option B — OAuth 2.0
If Cursor suggests OAuth, prepare:
Google Cloud OAuth app
Local redirect handler
Token storage
Core Requirements
1. Import Watch Later list
Tool must:
Read the entire Watch Later playlist
Extract video titles + URLs
Store them (JSON or local DB)
2. Download videos
Each video must be downloaded as:
Minimum resolution: 720p
Prefer best available quality that is ≥720p
MP4 format if possible
If not available, fallback to:
Merged formats (video + audio)
3. File naming rules
Format:
<index> - <video_title>.mp4
Avoid invalid filename characters.
4. Logging
Log file should include:
Start/end time
Success downloads
Failed downloads
Videos already downloaded
Optional Features (if Cursor can implement)
A. Resume interrupted downloads
Store progress and skip completed ones.
B. Auto-clean Watch Later
After successful download, automatically remove the video from Watch Later (optional toggle).
C. GUI
Simple Electron/Vue interface (optional future step).
